# Cafeteria Management
The database system has been developed to serve as a centralized system for cafeterias and food-courts. The system maintains order and bill records of the customers to avoid the need of a manual system, as was present in our Institute (<a href="https://www.iiitdmj.ac.in/">IIIT Jabalpur</a>). The ongoing scenario included keeping a manual record of any pending payments and orders.

Accordingly, through this project, the developers aimed to create a centralized system where users can access the portal using the Institute's ID and place the orders online to avoid long queues.

The project was specifically designed for our Institute, and thus contains data of six canteens. It can however be customised as per your requirements.

# Functionalities
**1. SignIn/SignUp**
In order to place any orders, the user must first create an account using their Institute ID and password, or log in to the already registered account. Attempting to place an order without signing in will redirect the user to the signup section of the page. </br>

**2. Deciding where to eat!**
The home page also contains a list of canteens the users can choose from. As mentioned above, the list includes six canteens according to our Institute.

**3. Placing Orders**
After the user has chosen their dining place, the corresponding page will appear which includes a list of all the items available along with their corresponding prices. The user can enter the amount of each item ordered, and accordingly the bill will be generated after clicking the 'Place Order' button.

The system has been set up using HTML, PHP and MySQL database. By looking at the SQL queries (PHP files), you could create your own database provided you keep the name of the columns same as the code (alternatively change the name at both the places).

The files can be used as a template to create your own database project.
